# Diabetes Prediction App ðŸ©º

This project is a Machine Learning web app that predicts whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on input features. The app is built with Python, trained in Google Colab using scikit-learn, and deployed using Streamlit.

## Features
- Trained multiple models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and more
- Visualized data distributions and feature importance
- Evaluated models using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, and Classification Report
- Saved trained models using `joblib` with compression
- Streamlit interface for live predictions
